# 🛡️ Zero Trust Architecture: Project Overview

This project simulates a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) strategy using Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft Defender tools. It does not require a live Azure environment. Instead, it showcases risk-based access control, identity protection, incident response, and Conditional Access policies through documented scenarios.

## 🔍 What This Project Demonstrates

- Zero Trust Principles: Never trust, always verify.
- Risk-Based Access: Dynamically assess user and device risk.
- Conditional Access: Enforce policies based on real-time signals.
- Incident Response: Simulated responses using Microsoft Defender for Identity, Endpoint, and Cloud.

## 📂 Contents

- `compromised_identity_flow.md` – Simulated attack from a compromised identity.
- `defender_incident_response.md` – Incident response flow using Defender.
- `conditional_access_scenarios.md` – Policy examples blocking risky users/devices.
- `risk_based_access_matrix.md` – A matrix to align user/device risk with access.

Use these files to simulate realistic Zero Trust policies without deploying a live environment.
