# üîê Zero Trust Simulation Using Microsoft Defender Tools

A simulated Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) implementation designed for learning and portfolio demonstration. This project showcases how Microsoft Defender tools and Microsoft Entra ID can be used to implement Zero Trust principles like risk-based access, continuous verification, and least-privilege access ‚Äî **all without requiring a paid Azure subscription**.

## üìå Project Overview

**Goal:** To document and simulate a real-world Zero Trust security framework using Microsoft security tools in a mock enterprise environment.

This project aligns with key concepts from the **SC-900: Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals** certification and is designed to strengthen both theoretical understanding and practical presentation skills.
